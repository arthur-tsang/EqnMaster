Neural Arithmetic and Equation Solver

## Summary
In this project, we explore the use of RNNs, LSTMs, and the like to solve arithmetic problems. So far, we have a baseline and simple rnnlm model set up for 3-digit addition.

## To-do list
* Think about other evaluation metrics
* Learn Theano
* Write encoder-decoder RNN, LSTM
* Try training digit-specific LSTMs (more of a tangent)

## Dependencies
The only dependency we're using right now is `numpy`, though we plan to integrate `theano` in the near future.
